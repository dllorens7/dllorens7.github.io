            <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
            Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Daniel Llorens, and I’m passionate about engineering, design, and technology. 
            Over the years, I’ve developed a broad set of skills ranging from computer-aided design to embedded 
            programming. My journey into engineering began with a deep fascination with how things work, and this curiosity 
            continues to fuel my drive for innovation. On my free time, I enjoy rowing as part of my school's Varsity Crew 
            team and being a leader through my board positions in some of my school's clubs, including the Computer Science
            Club and the JustHumanity Club, whose mission is to advocate for those that are vulnerable and underrepresented.
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            Currently, I am also focused on mastering various engineering techniques and applying them to real-world 
            projects. This portfolio showcases some of my key projects, skills, and the tools I’ve learned along 
            the way. From 3D scanning and printing to electronics production, I thrive on challenging myself with 
            diverse problems to solve.
