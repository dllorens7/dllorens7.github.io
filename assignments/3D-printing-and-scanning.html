            3D Printing is the first part of this assignment. The goal here is to create and 3D print an object that demonstrates the unique capabilities of 
            additive manufacturing. Some project constraints are the design's size (a few cubic centimeters maximum) and that the design must be impossible 
            or impractical to create through subtractive manufacturing. I used Fusion to create my design because it is the CAD software I am best at.

            The first thing I did was create a construction-type sketch in the form of a square on the ground to set my constraints for the length and width of my 
            design. Since I was going to create a cube box as my base to work around (meaning I won't go beyond the bounds of the cube in my design), the box's length and width were going to be less than the length and width 
            of the square construction-type sketch. Moreover, the length, width, and height of a cube are all equal, and the length, width, and height constraints 
            for the assignment are all equal too. Thus, by creating this cube, I was also ensuring that I wouldn't exceed the height constraints given to me. I
            then made 3 equal, square sketches on sides of the cube in each of the 3 planes (x, y, z). All of these squares were centered on the sides' centers.

        <p>
            Next I did a cutting extrude on each of the sketches on the sides of the cube, all going completely through the cube.

        <p>
            To give my design a more sleek aesthetic look, I used the Fillet tool to round out all the edges of the cube. I started with the top 16 edges. As you 
            can see above, I selected them one by one and then did the operation. The result of that is seen in the second image. I then did the same for all 
            other edges. I later realized that I could've saved myself a bit of time by using the multiselect tool where you drag a box over the entire design and it selects 
            all the edges.

            I then created a new construction plane and elevated it so that it stood halfway up the height of the cube. I specifically placed it at the midpoint of the height 
            to complement the two-way extrusion that I was going to do. I then sketched two centers each with a diameter of 3 mm and placed directly on the x-axis and at the midpoint between 
            the two ends of the structural cylinders parallel to each other (see the bottom two images). Finally,

            Ex: For this part of the Computer Aided Design assignment, I used the Autodesk Fusion CAD software to model the protective case 
            of my group's final project, the Boat Cyberdeck. I chose Fusion because it is the CAD program that I have the most experience
            in and feel most comfortable working in.
