            3D Printing is the first part of this assignment. The goal here is to create and 3D print an object that demonstrates the unique capabilities of 
            additive manufacturing. Some project constraints are the design's size (a few cubic centimeters maximum) and that the design must be impossible 
            or impractical to create through subtractive manufacturing. I used Fusion to create my design because it is the CAD software I am best at.
        </p>

            The first thing I did was create a construction-type sketch in the form of a 65 mm x 65 mm square on the ground to set my constraints for the length and width of my 
            design. Since I was going to create a cube box as my base to work around (meaning I won't go beyond the bounds of the cube in my design), the box's length and width were going to be less than the length and width 
            of the square construction-type sketch. I made the cube 60 mm x 60 mm x 60 mm. Moreover, the length, width, and height of a cube are all equal, and the length, width, and height constraints 
            for the assignment are all equal too. Thus, by creating this cube, I was also ensuring that I wouldn't exceed the height constraints given to me. I
            then made three equal, 50 mm x 50 mm square sketches on sides of the cube in each of the three planes (x, y, z). All of these squares were centered on the sides' centers.

        <p>
            Next I did a cutting extrude on each of the sketches on the sides of the cube, all going completely through the cube.

            To give my design a more sleek aesthetic look, I used the Fillet tool with to round out all the edges of the cube with a radius of 2.5 mm. I started with the top 16 edges. As you 
            can see above, I selected them one by one and then did the operation. The result of that is seen in the second image. I then did the same for all 
            other edges. I later realized that I could've saved myself a bit of time by using the multiselect tool where you drag a box over the entire design and it selects 
            all the edges.

            I then created a new construction plane and elevated it so that it stood halfway up the height of the cube. I specifically placed it at the midpoint of the height 
            to complement the two-way extrusion that I was going to do. I then sketched two centers each with a diameter of 3 mm and placed directly on the x-axis and at the midpoint between 
            the two ends of the structural cylinders parallel to each other (see the bottom two images). Finally, I created a symmetric, two way extrusion, making sure that both ends of the 
            new column I was creating resided perfectly inside the larger cylinders above and below.

            After creating a second new construction plane elevated higher than the ground but lower than the first construction plane, I selected the 
            plane and sketched two more circles along with a line connecting the that ran straight over the x-axis. Each of the circles was placed on 
            one of the two columns I had just made, with their centers aligned with the centers of the circles I had previously made to use as my 
            foundations for the columns. These new circles also had a diameter a little wider than the old circles, so that their circumference surpasses 
            that of the columns'.

            The next step was to use the Sweep tool to create a cylinder path that ran along the sketch lines I had just created. After putting some thought into it, 
            I concluded that I would have to sketch a few more circles in specific locations on the circles and connecting line that would become the path, so that they would be the profiles used in the Sweep operation. These new circles would have to be 
            sketched perpendicular to the path on which they were sketched, would have to have their center on the path, and their circumference and diameter would be 
            the circumference and diameter of the new cylinder path. I created all three circles I made with a diameter of 0.6 mm.

            Here is the design after it has finished being 3D printed. As you can see, it was printed with some automatic tree-like 
            supports that enables and facilitates the printing process. I carefully removed these from the design with my hands.

            Here are some final looks at the finished product from various perspectives. In conclusion, it turned out that 
            despite my adjustments, many parts of my design were still to thin. For that reason, some parts, such as the columns, weren't able to print properly.
            However, the bar in the middle connected to the rings can fortunately still move up and down along the columns, which was my original intention for this design.

            For this part of the assignment we had to scan an existing object and produce an accurate digital model of it. To do that I chose to use the 
            3D scanning mobile app called Polycam, as it was the most highly rated online out of all the ones I found. I decided that the object I was going to 3D scan and model was going to be my Rubik's Cube.

                The way the scanning works is the following: You take over 25 pictures of your object from different angles. 
                Your photos are then uploaded and processed by the app and it then generates a model. You can take your photos manually or automatically. 
                Manually means you have to click the button to take the picture yourself and you set your own pace and decide when to take the photos. 
                Automatically has the app takes photos for you when it deems it a good moment to do so as you move your camera around your object.

                I watched a quick tutorial and tried my first attempt at scanning the Rubik's Cube. I did it with the automatic photo setting. I must have 
                shown too much of the background of the room I was in throughout many of my shots, because it seems to be that the program focused in on the background.
                Not much Rubik's Cube was shown.

                For this second attempt shown above I actually scourged the app and watched every single possibke tutorial I could find. 
                I made sure I understood each and every part of it before I did the scanning. I also used the automatic photo setting in this one. The result was pretty good apart from the two sides that are missing, 
                some mixing of color, and an overall cloudy and smeary look. After what I witnessed in the first attempt, I was very pleased with this one.

            I ultimately decided to go for one last attempt to see if I could finally get a complete, near perfect scan while trying the manual photo setting.
            I even went as far as to turn on a special feature that would let me take shots from more angles. The result was very disappointing. I believe the mix of just my manual photo taking being poor
            and also the fact that I just took far too many photos and from far too many angles confused the syetem and made it think we might be focusing on the gray table. 
            Regardless, I stay with the second scan as the best.
