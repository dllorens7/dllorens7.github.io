        <h2>3D Final Project Product Case Design</h2>

        <p>
            For this part of the Computer Aided Design assignment, I used the Autodesk Fusion CAD software to model the protective case 
            of my group's final project, the Boat Cyberdeck. I chose Fusion because it is the CAD program that I have the most experience
            in and feel most comfortable working in. 
        </p>
        <br> <br> <br> <br>

        <!-- Layout 2: Two images side by side with full-width text -->
        <div class="layout-3">
            <img src="/images/3D CAD/Image 1.01.png" alt="Step 3 Image 1">

        <p>
            Making rough estimations, I first decided on the dimensions for my case. I ultimately decided on a height of 11 cm, a length
            of 24 cm, and a width of 20 cm. Since my plan is to make one half of the case (one of the two lids) and then duplicate it, I
            have to divide the height by 2. I also have to convert the dimensions from cm to mm because in Fusion I am going to be working
            in mm. The final dimensions for the box I am going to be starting off with are going to be 55 mm x 240 mm x 200 mm. I then used
            the Shell tool to shell the box, selecting an inside thickness of 8 mm.

        </div>
        <p>
            Next, I used the Fillet tool on the inside and outside of the corners to round them out with a fillet size of 10 mm, and did the
            same thing with the bottom edges of the box but that time with a fillet size of 5 mm instead.
        </p>

                I then made a copy of the entire body I had just created it and moved it in the y direction, so that it would be placed next
                to the original on the correct side where they would later be connected with the hinges. As to how far I moved it, I expereminted
                with the distances until I settled on a displacement of -240 mm in the y direction, which provided a 25 mm gap between the two bodies.

        </div>
        <p>
            Now to start working on the hinges. As you can see in the first image, I created a construction plane using a face from the side of the 
            original body as a reference and then offsetting it 10 mm into the body. I did this so that when I created a sketch on that construction
            plane, I would be working at a depth where I wasn't affected by the rounded corners and so that when I later extruded the sketch, the
            created hinge would be on the side of the body and not on its corner. For the sketch, I created a circle with a diameter of 19 mm and
            its center exactly halfway between the two bodies. I then created a line tangent to that circle running accross and connecting the circle 
            to the side of the body. I then extruded that whole sketch, sketched a smaller circle into the circular face of the extruded hinge, and 
            created a smaller cylinder sticking out. I used the fillet tool to smooth out the end of the cylinder a little.
