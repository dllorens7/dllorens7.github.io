        <h2>3D Final Project Product Case Design</h2>

        <!-- Introduction for h2 -->
        <p>
            For this part of the Computer Aided Design assignment, I used the Autodesk Fusion CAD software to model the protective case 
            of my group's final project, the Boat Cyberdeck. I chose Fusion because it is the CAD program that I have the most experience
            in and feel most comfortable working in. 
        </p>
        <br> <br> <br> <br>

        <!-- Layout 2: Two images side by side with full-width text -->
        <div class="layout-3">
            <img src="/images/3D CAD/Image 1.01.png" alt="Step 3 Image 1">

        <p>
            Making rough estimations, I first decided on the dimensions for my case. I ultimately decided on a height of 11 cm, a length
            of 24 cm, and a width of 20 cm. Since my plan is to make one half of the case (one of the two lids) and then duplicate it, I
            have to divide the height by 2. I also have to convert the dimensions from cm to mm because in Fusion I am going to be working
            in mm. The final dimensions for the box I am going to be starting off with are going to be 55 mm x 240 mm x 200 mm. I then used
            the Shell tool to shell the box, selecting an inside thickness of 8 mm.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            Next, I used the Fillet tool on the inside and outside of the corners to round them out with a fillet size of 10 mm, and did the
            same thing with the bottom edges of the box but that time with a fillet size of 5 mm instead.

                I then made a copy of the entire body I had just created it and moved it in the y direction, so that it would be placed next
                to the original on the correct side where they would later be connected with the hinges. As to how far I moved it, I expereminted
                with the distances until I settled on a displacement of -240 mm in the y direction, which provided a 25 mm gap between the two bodies.

            Now to start working on the hinges, beginning with the first male hinge. As you can see in the first image, I created a construction plane using a face from the side of the 
            original body as a reference and then offsetting it 10 mm into the body. I did this so that when I created a sketch on that construction
            plane, I would be working at a depth where I wasn't affected by the rounded corners and so that when I later extruded the sketch, the
            created hinge would be on the side of the body and not on its corner. For the sketch, I created a circle with a diameter of 19 mm and
            its center exactly halfway between the two bodies. I then created a line tangent to that circle running accross and connecting the circle 
            to the side of the body. I then extruded that whole sketch, sketched a smaller circle into the circular face of the extruded hinge, and 
            created a smaller cylinder sticking out. I used the Fillet tool to smooth out the sides of the end of the cylinder.
        </p>
        <br> <br> <br> <br>

        <!-- Layout 3: Three Images -->
        <div class="layout-3">
            <img src="/images/3D CAD/Image 1.09.png" alt="Image">

        </div>
        <p>
            I created a second (female) hinge connected to the second body that would be compatible with the first (male) hinge I created. I repeated the steps I 
            already did for the male hinge, consisting of the sketch and an extrusion, making the sketch on a construction plane slightly offset 
            from the face of the male hinge, as a way to create a small separation space between the two hinges. What I did different for the 
            female hinge was that instead of creating the smaller cylinder sticking out like in the male hinge, I actually used the combine tool 
            with a "cut" operation to use the small cylinder from the male hinge to cut a hole in the shape of the small cylinder inside the female 
            hinge. To make it possible for the small cylinder to fit and rotate in the whole of the female hinge if we were to actually print this 
            CAD design, I offset the face of the hole by 0.05 mm.

            In preparation for mirroring over the hinges I already created to the other side of the bodies, I created a midplane halfway throughout
            the second "case" body. However, I ran into the problem that for mirroring, I had to actually make the hinges and the cases different 
            bodies. To do so, I had to split each of the two hinge-case bodies into two seperate bodies; one for the case and one for the hinge.
            I had to get an outside face that would align well with where I wanted to make the cut to use as my splitting tool, so I creatively 
            created a box on the side whose sole purpose was to have one of its faces be used as the cut tool. Then I used the midplane to mirror 
            both the female and male hinge bodies.

            Finally its finished! This design took me some time and I had to do quite a bit of research combined with my own creativity to solve 
            some problems that arose, but now that it is completed I am really proud of it and am happy I devoted all those hours into it. Above 
            are two views of the completed Cyberdeck case design.

        <h2>2D Logo Design</h2>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p>
            In this assignment, we are to each create a 2D Logo for our "company" (aka my student group), which is working on the Cyberdeck 
            product. I decided to use the Notability app on my iPad for this, since I know Notability is great for visual design, including 
            color, geometric designs, etc. I have also used notability to take notes in school and complete school assignments since I had
            an iPad for school, so I am very accustomed to the app.
        </p>
        <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <img src="/images/2D CAD/2D_1.jpg" alt="Image">
            <p>
                First I decided to explore the note templates that Notability offers, since I thought I might be able to use them as 
                insipration for the logo designs. I stumbled upon this interesting hexagonal design and decided to work with it.

        <p>
            I liked the special cyan color of the hexagons in the template background so I decided to use the color picking tool that 
            allows me to copy the color of whatever I hover my little magnifying-glass-looking tool over. After I had obtained that 
            particular tone of cyan, I tested out a couple of other colors in Notability's available color palette. I ultimately settled 
            on that special cyan and a dark blue I found, which actually match with the colors of this portfolio website (as you might 
            be able to tell I really like the color blue).

            After getting my colors. I started to mess around with the hexagonal pattern to create blue hexagons and different figures.
            I decided to create this shape that looks almost like a person with his four limbs spread out and without a head. I tried 
            seeing how it looked as I flipped it sideways, upside down, etc. and added more touches such as a black area of filling and 
            a yellow triangle, until I finally had my finished logo design (the third design in the seoond image above).
