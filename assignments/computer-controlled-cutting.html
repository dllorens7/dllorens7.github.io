            For this laser cutting project, the goal was to create a 3D fit together puzzle that could then be laser-cut into a wooden slab inside a 
            Glowforge Pro laser cutter machine that we have in my school's STEAM center. Along the way I also learned about laser kerf, material choices, 
            good fit, and other things.

            <p>
                I decided to create my design that was going to be cut in Fusion, as I am very familiar with the program. Due to the limited size of the wooden slab that I was going to cut my design out of, I had to ensure that the dimensions of my design 
                wouldn't exceed it, or else part of the design simply wouldn't be cut later on when I go to cut it. Thus, I made some measurements of 
                the slab and determined that as a safeguard I should make my design fit into a square of sides 160 mm in length. Using the construction
                lines in Fusion I created such a square.

        </div>
        <p>
            With my dimension constraints set up, I got straight to work on a design that I had already envisioned in my head. The idea was for the laser cutter to cut anywhere where there is a line in my design. I created a design with 
            three main pieces that interlocked together to create a square after a series of movements. And then some extra pieces could be placed in to create a perfect, entirely filled square. This might be hard to understand, and 
            it is hard to explain in detail, so just stay with me until the end were I will show what I mean through a video. Above you see the first
            attempt at the finsished design. On the left is the complete design, and on the left is the same thing, except that the rectangles that are to 
            be removed for the puzzle to work properly are highlighted and traced around in red. I made two mistakes here. The first is that for the big 
            piece on the right I have to make it longer on its bottom end so that when it slides up, that extra part sticking out fits perfectly to form 
            the square. The second, smaller, issue is that the small highlighted rectangle all the way at the top right corner doesn't even have to be there 
            at all. I can just eliminate that all togther.

            The first image is of how the wood piece looks straight off of being cut. The next image shows all the pieces neatly seperated. I didn't include 
            the outer covering wood piece, as that piece is just there to hold the pieces together and not really connected to the puzzle in any way. The last 
            image shows the puzzle after it has been completed, with the square formed. Click <a href="https://youtu.be/PKOHx_zZUK4">here</a> to see a half-a-minute long video of me completing the puzzle.

            In this Vinyl Cutting project, the objective was to design a sticker, decal, or similarly themed item to place on my computer/iPad/project/etc. 
            I first had to create the design and then, very similarly to the laser cutting project, we exported the .dxf file to send to a machine (in this 
            case a Cricut cutting machine) that cuts out the design in layers.

                This is a picture of the finished sketch. In case you are not able to tell, I chose to make a design of a rowing boat, and, more specifically, 
                a double. I chose this design because I am a rower and it is something I am passionate about. As usual with my projects, I created the design in Fusion. In this design in particular, I made 
                heavy use of the mirroring tool to reflect parts of the design over vertical and horizontal lines and save myslef the effort of having to 
                redo the dame thing over again, not to mention run the risk of making a mistake and then having two different versions of the smae type of 
                object even though they are supposed to look the same. For example, I mirrored the top half of the boat over a horizontal line to create the 
                boat's bottom half. I also used the mirroring tool to create all four oars, mirring two of them to the other side of the boat.

            After finishing in Fusion, I wanted to make some finishing touches and add color to my design, so I put the Fusion sketch into the Affinity Designer 2
            app on my iPad and did just that. However, I ran into some problems right off the bat because Affinity appeared not to register some of the line of the 
            boat being connected when they connected at sharp angles, so I basically had to retrace everything. When I was done with that, I wanted to have the boat 
            follow the same look as the boats that I row in with the Belen Varsity Crew Team in terms of color and oar design, so I made a pattern of three parallel 
            diagonal lines on the oars. Finally, I colored in everything in the yellow, black, and blue colors of Belen's rowing boats.

            Once I was done with the design, I exported it as a PNG and opened it on the computer that is used to run the Cricut machine. 
            On that computer, I made the necessary preparations and setup for the cutting in the compatible Cricut app. When I selected
            that I wanted to cut it in layers, it automatically marked the white background of the image as a layer, which I had to remove 
            because the white background is not part of the sticker itself.

            Now that everything was set up I satrted cutting. I cut each layer using the color sheets for each of the corresponding color layers. The picture on the right 
            shows each of the three layers that was cut. It is hard to see the design on them, especially for the yellow one, but if you look closely you might be able to notice it.

            I carefully peeled off all the non-important parts (mostly the background) in each of the three vinyl color pieces. The result is the first picture. As you can see,
            the way this works is that the yellow is the first (bottom) layer, the blue is the second (middle) layer, and then the final (top) layer is the black. I carefully
            placed the stickers on top of each other in that order until I eventually had the final version (last image), which is a combination of all three.
