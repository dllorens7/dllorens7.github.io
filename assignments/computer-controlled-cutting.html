            For this laser cutting assignment, the goal was to create a 3D fit together puzzle that could then be laser-cut into a wooden slab inside a 
            Glowforge Pro laser cutter machine that we have in my school's STEAM center. Along the way I also learned about laser kerf, material choices, 
            good fit, and other things.

                I decided to create my design that was going to be cut in Fusion, as I am very familiar with the program. Due to the limited size of the wooden slab that I was going to cut my design out of, I had to ensure that the dimensions of my design 
                wouldn't exceed it, or else part of the design simply wouldn't be cut later on when I go to cut it. Thus, I made some measurements of 
                the slab and determined that as a safeguard I should make my design fit into a square of sides 160 mm in length. Using the construction
                lines in Fusion I created such a square.

        <p>
            With my dimension constraints set up, I got straight to work on a design that I had already envisioned in my head. The idea was for the laser cutter to cut anywhere where there is a line in my design. I created a design with 
            three main pieces that interlocked together to create a square after a series of movements. And then some extra pieces could be placed in to create a perfect, entirely filled square. This might be hard to understand, and 
            it is hard to explain in detail, so just stay with me until the end were I will show what I mean through a video. Above you see the first
            attempt at the finsished design. On the left is the complete design, and on the left is the same thing, except that the rectangles that are to 
            be removed for the puzzle to work properly are highlighted and traced around in red. I made two mistakes here. The first is that for the big 
            piece on the right I have to make it longer on its bottom end so that when it slides up, that extra part sticking out fits perfectly to form 
            the square. The second, smaller, issue is that the small highlighted rectangle all the way at the top right corner doesn't even have to be there 
            at all. I can just eliminate that all togther.

            The first image is of how the wood piece looks straight off of being cut. The next image shows all the pieces neatly seperated. I didn't include 
            the outer covering wood piece, as that piece is just there to hold the pieces together and not really connected to the puzzle in any way. The last 
            image shows the puzzle after it has been completed, with the square formed. Click <a href="https://youtu.be/PKOHx_zZUK4">here</a> to see a half-a-minute long video of me completing the puzzle.
