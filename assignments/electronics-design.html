        <!-- OPTIONAL: Intro to Asignment -->
        <p>
            This project consisted of using an electronics computer aided design software called KiCAD to create a circuit that can take a power source 
            and run an output component (LED, MOTOR, etc). Our teacher first walked us through the program and taught us the basics of how to use it. 
            Then he gave us the assignment, which was to design a circuit with a battery, an LED, a button, and a resistor.
        </p>

            I started with getting some components and then importing them into the schematic editor as "symbols". This included a single-cell battery,
            a resistor, and an LED. I linked these three symbols with green "wires". As I was doing this, I ran the "Electrical Rules Checker" test to 
            ensure there were no problems with my design.
        </p>

            <p>
                I then added another LED, another resistor, and two button switches.

        <p>
            To actually move into creating my circuit board in my PCB editor, I had to link these symbols I had added unto my schmeatic editor to real world 
            parts. This required me to create footprints for each of the parts. Using a list of real world parts that the teacher gave us and that correpsonded 
            to each type of part, I added these footprints. I first had to add teh symbols and then look up the name to add the footprint, as you can see I am 
            doing with the resistor in the pictures above.

                After I had added all the necessary footprints, I could move on into the PCB editor.

            The amount of parts I had planned to use in my design was going to be too much in the case that I actually made a model of my ciruit 
            board in real life (my STEAM center doesn't have the resources to provide that many parts to all the students in my class), so I ended 
            up settling for the basics: a battery, an LED, and a button switch. Above, in the first picture, you see the parts after I opened up 
            the PCB editor. I then organized the parts in a way to efficiently connect them with wires. The next step was actually adding the 
            wires and creating a box around the circuits.

                The final touches were to increase the thickness of the wire and insert the text "DANIEL'S CIRCUIT" in the top left of the circuit.
