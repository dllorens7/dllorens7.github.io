            We have already ordered many different parts that we are gonna use to start building the Cyberdeck, 
            but only one has arrived so far: the monitor. More specifically, a 10.1” Portable HDMA Monitor from 
            HAMTYSAN.

            We unpacked the monitor and the extra little parts that came with it. Then we put it together as 
            necessary.

                We tested out the monitor by connecting it to a laptop with an HDMI cable and were able to not only 
                mirror the laptop’s screen but also control it thanks to the monitor’s touch screen features.

        Today we did some research on the different ways we could power the Cyberdeck. We figured we should go with 
        some type of battery. We luckily had some batteries around the place, so we used those to start to visualize 
        and estimate what size parameters we would probably be limited to and what size of battery we should order 
        (if we even have to order any).

                This class we focused on how we were going to make the Cyberdeck's case. We all had developed various designs 
                for it through CAD modeling already, so we figured we should choose the best one, make any necessary adjustments,
                and then just 3D-print it. The image below shows the 3D Printer that we will likely be using.

        I was absent.

        <p class="source-title"> Day 6 &nbsp; (11 / 22 / 24) </p>

        I learned how to embed videos and documents into my website, which will be very useful especially for embedding the PDR (Preliminary Design Review) into 
        this "Component 3: Solution Design" page as a live, working document (see below past the Daily Updates). Then created the Google Docs document that we 
        will be using to complete the PDR and copy pasted all the sections from the assignment instructions.

            We ordered a ton of battery cells to create a custom battery to power our computer. The small pink cylinders are the individual cells, and the spot 
            welder in the first picture is used to connect the cells together using high voltage. The last picture is of a multimeter, to measure and detect 
            voltage levels.

                We divided up the different sections of the Cyberdeck PDR between each of the members in the group. We then started working on it.

        <p>
            I and everyone in my group spent the entire time working on the PDR for our Cyberdeck final project.

            Today was a shorter class and my group recorded the different clips that we will later edit and put together to create a PDR Video 
            Presentation for the final project.

            Today we worked on the batteries all class. This consisted of spot welding 22 batteries together to get an end result of 4 volts and 77,000 Mah of power, which theoretically is enough to keep the Cyberdeck running for 24 hours continuously. 
            The first picture shows the current state of the cyberdeck, with a digital multimeter next to it. In the welding process, we connected the positive leads together and then the negative leads together. The clamps were used to hold the batteries together while we super-glued all the cells together. The last picture is of us wrapping the batteries in electrical tape to protect the electrical contacts.
