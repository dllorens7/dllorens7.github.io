        <div class = "indent">
            <p> The device must be capable of delivering 24 hours of continuous use under a 25W power load, verified through endurance testing with real-world workloads. </p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="source-title"> 2) Waterproofing </p>
        <div class = "indent">
            <p> The exterior of the container must achieve an IP68 rating, ensuring it is dustproof and capable of being submerged in water up to 1 meter for 30 minutes without any water ingress.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="source-title"> 3) Water-Resistant Internals </p>

        <div class = "indent">
            <p> The compartment for a secondary battery must be sized to fit a standardized lithium-ion battery pack with a capacity of at least 10,000 mAh, allowing for easy swapping without tools in less than 30 seconds.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="source-title"> 7) SD Card Storage </p>
        <div class = "indent">
            <p> The SD card compartment must be capable of securely holding a minimum of 5 standard-size SD cards, each in its own slot to prevent misplacement or damage during transport.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="source-title"> 8) Retractable USB-C Cable </p>
        <div class = "indent">

        </div>
        
        <p class="source-title"> 9) Mechanical Keyboard </p>
        <div class = "indent">
            <p> The full-size mechanical keyboard must have at least 84 keys, with a key switch rated for 50 million presses, ensuring it withstands heavy use. The keyboard must also be able to operate in temperatures ranging from -10°C to 50°C.</p>

        <p class="source-title"> Conclusion </p>
        <p>
            It was a close call, but ultimately the Compact Build wins over the Large Build 52 to 51,
            so we will develop the Compact Build design. However, at a later point, once we are finished
            with the Compact Build, we might try developing the larger version of the Cyberdeck as a way
            to introduce more product variation and options for consumers.

        <p>
            We have already ordered many different parts that we are gonna use to start building the Cyberdeck, 
            but only one has arrived so far: the monitor. More specifically, a 10.1” Portable HDMA Monitor from 
            HAMTYSAN.
